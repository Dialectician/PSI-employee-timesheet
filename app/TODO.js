    -Made firstname/lastname larger and italic
    -Switched QTD_worked and QTD_expected
    -Time Tracker: Confirmation when delete.
    -Time Tracker: Round to nearest tenth of an hour.
    -Fixed - Android: duplicate message does not fit.
    -Flex Hours: updateEntry PUT working

TODO:

This Week:
    -Fixing flex time on TodaysCharges/Update
    -problem deleting. Normally, if I change it to 0 its status to 3. Then, I make 3 lists based on their status. But, for some reason it only deletes on the 2nd try.
    -Can update to letters on updateEntry
    -Updating/New/Delete PTO needs polishing

Next Week:
    -Fix pull down to reload on todaysJobs
    -MAIN: on Android, make it so no scroll.
    -auto pick job if 1 option
    -Android: AddEntry (choose things), then press back button and AddEntry again.

Bugs:
    -Put a 2000 ml timer after every function.
