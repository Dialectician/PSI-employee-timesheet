What I Did:
    -tracked hours:   charged hours: to main screen
    -Fixed PTO on AddEntry screen

TODO:
    -Try and add 'ok' to make sure it doesnt get overridden, OR concatenate into one message OR ('Your flex hours have been changed to the proper value')

Bugs:
    -Put a 2000 ml timer after every function.
    -look into ssl certificates
    -Dont want to pick job number if 1
    -Add 50 to PTO twice
    -stop negative being said "not a number"
    -how to update negative with iPhone?
