What I Did:
    -Made firstname/lastname larger and italic
    -Switched QTD_worked and QTD_expected

TODO:

    -Fixing flex time on TodaysCharges/Update
    -Time Tracker: Confirmation when delete. Round to nearest tenth of an hour.
    -Android: AddEntry - duplicate message does not fit.
    -Fix pull down to reload on todaysJobs

    -MAIN: on Android, make it so no scroll.

    -auto pick job if 1 option

    -problem deleting. Normally, if I change it to 0 its status to 3. Then, I make 3 lists based on their status. But, for some reason it only deletes on the 2nd try.
    -Can update to letters on updateEntry
    -Android: AddEntry (choose things), then press back button and AddEntry again.
    -Updating/New/Delete PTO needs polishing

Bugs:
    -Put a 2000 ml timer after every function.
    -Dont want to pick job number if 1
