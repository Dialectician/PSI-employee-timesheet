What I Did:
    -Was able to work full-time this week (took a week off, so next week is the last we are allowed to charge up until. It will most likely be done by next week and ready for beta testing).
    -Fixed adding PTO twice
    -tracked hours:   charged hours: to main screen
    -Fixed PTO on AddEntry screen
    -Got rid of checkbox on iPhone and now theres negative
    -concatenated messages on AddEntry screen
    -Negative number not alerted bad on update
    -PTO works on updateEntry (had to use Old_Hours for PUT so a good thing you made it). Fixed it for PUT AND POST.
    -Got rid of messages on updateEntry screen. Theres a bunch of charges updated on screen, so makes no sense to print message. Will just confuse user.
    -Added pulldown to todaysCharges but still working on it

TODO:
    -Can update to letters on updateEntry
    -Fix pull down to reload on todaysJobs

Bugs:
    -Put a 2000 ml timer after every function.
    -Dont want to pick job number if 1
